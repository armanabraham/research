Data and R code
=================
Data and code to reproduce analysis reported in the manuscript "Low intensity TMS enhances perception of visual stimuli". You can download all files and run "Data\_analysis\_and\_figures.Rmd" which will knit an HTML file that will contain the analysis and figures. It is easier to do this in RStudio. Alternatively, you can see the analysis and figures online by clicking   [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/armanabraham/research/blob/master/Weak_TMS_Enhances_Perception/Data_analysis_and_figures_v2.html). 

For convenience, the data can also be downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet.
