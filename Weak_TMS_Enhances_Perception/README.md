Data and R code
=================
Data and code to reproduce analysis reported in the manuscript "Low intensity TMS enhances perception of visual stimuli". You can download all files and run "Data\_analysis\_and\_figures.Rmd" which will knit an HTML file showing the analysis. It is easier to do this in RStudio. Alternatively, you can see the HTML file showing the results by clicking  [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/armanabraham/research/blob/master/Weak_TMS_Enhances_Perception/Data_analysis_and_figures.html). 

There is also an Excel spreadsheet that only contains the data.
